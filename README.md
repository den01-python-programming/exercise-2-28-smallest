# Exercise 2.28 Smallest

Define a two-parameter method `smallest` that returns the smaller of the two numbers passed to it as parameters.

```python
def smallest(number1, number2):
    # write your code here
    # do not print anything inside the method

    # there must be a return command at the end

def main():
    answer =  smallest(2, 7)
    print("Smallest: " + str(answer))
```

The output of the program:

```plaintext
Smallest: 2
```
